### Hi there 👋

I am in my final bachelor's year of Information Technology engineering looking for opportunities and collabaration in projects related to data science and deep learning.

I have no special talents. I am only passionately curious.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning to better my skills, one line of code at a time.
- 🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on data science and deep learning projects.
